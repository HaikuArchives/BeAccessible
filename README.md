### How to build
Simply navigate to the `src` directory and run `make`.

### Notes
There are 2 versions of the code included here:

* The src directory contains the most recent code, with unreleased (and probably buggy) features.  It is based on SQLite v3. The main new features are the ability to import files and the ability to filter data in a table (by right-clicking in a cell and selecting "Filter For...").

* The "BeAccessible_041804.zip" file contains the code from the last release which was in April 2004 (see http://www.bebits.com/app/3613).  This version was (relatively) stable and was based on SQLite 2.8.11.
